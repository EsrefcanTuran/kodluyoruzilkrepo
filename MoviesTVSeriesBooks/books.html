    <h3>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h3>
    <p>
      Harry has been burdened with a dark, dangerous and seemingly impossible
      task: that of locating and destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes.
      Never has Harry felt so alone, or faced a future so full of shadows. But
      Harry must somehow find within himself the strength to complete the task
      he has been given. He must leave the warmth, safety and companionship of
      The Burrow and follow without fear or hesitation the inexorable path laid
      out for him... In this final, seventh installment of the Harry Potter
      series, J.K. Rowling unveils in spectacular fashion the answers to the
      many questions that have been so eagerly awaited.

    <h3>The Art of War</h3>
    <p>
      Twenty-Five Hundred years ago, Sun Tzu wrote this classic book of military
      strategy based on Chinese warfare and military thought. Since that time,
      all levels of military have used the teaching on Sun Tzu to warfare and
      civilization have adapted these teachings for use in politics, business
      and everyday life. The Art of War is a book which should be used to gain
      advantage of opponents in the boardroom and battlefield alike.
